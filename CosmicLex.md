## Nouns (Twings)

The core of CosmicLex lies in its ability to represent the fundamental entities of the Twingverse through nouns, known as twings. Twings capture the essence of the universe, encompassing galaxies, stars, planets, particles, abstract concepts, and more. Each twing is identified by a unique name, granting it a distinct celestial identity.

With CosmicLex, we can describe and explore the characteristics, properties, and behaviors of various twings. Here are a few examples of twings and how they can be used:

1. **Star**: A twing representing a luminous celestial body composed of hot gases that emit light and heat. We can describe its attributes, such as its temperature, brightness, size, and composition, allowing us to paint a vivid picture of the star's nature.

    Example:
    ```
    define Sun as Star
    attribute Sun.temperature = "15 million degrees Celsius"
    attribute Sun.brightness = "Magnitude -26.74"
    attribute Sun.size = "1.39 million kilometers in diameter"
    attribute Sun.composition = "Primarily hydrogen and helium"
    ```

2. **Gravity**: A twing representing the fundamental force that attracts objects toward each other. We can describe the effects of gravity, its strength, and how it influences the motion and behavior of other twings.

    Example:
    ```
    define Gravity as force
