# Hitchhiker's Guide to the Twingverse

## üìñ Introduction

Twingverse is a distributed, open, and decentralized infrastructure for describing the universe.
Any object, person, place, thing, event, or concept can be described in the Twingverse.
starting with the most basic, fundamental, and universal concepts, the Twingverse will grow
to describe the entire universe.

     The Twingverse shall be a place where all anything can be 
     Identified, Described, Defined, Measured, and Quantified 
     in a way that is universal, consistent, and precise.

## ü™® Milestone 1 
Identify the fundamental concepts of the universe.
These concepts will be the building blocks of the Twingverse.
below is a list of the fundamental concepts of the universe as identified
during the initial research phase of the Twingverse project.
each of these will be called a "twing" in the Twingverse.

1. `Time` - defined as the universal measure of change.
2. `Space` - defined as the universal measure of distance.
3. `Matter` - defined as the universal measure of mass.
4. `Energy` - defined as the universal measure of power.
5. `Information` - defined as the universal measure of knowledge.
6. `Life` - defined as the universal measure of existence.
7. `Consciousness` - defined as the universal measure of awareness.
8. `Intelligence` - defined as the universal measure of understanding.
9. `Purpose` - defined as the universal measure of meaning.
10. `Love` - defined as the universal measure of compassion.
11. `Truth` - defined as the universal measure of reality.
12. `Beauty` - defined as the universal measure of perfection.

** the following concepts are not considered fundamental,
 as they are derived from the fundamental concepts above.
 
13. `Good` - defined as the universal measure of virtue.
14. `Evil` - defined as the universal measure of vice.
15. `God` - defined as the universal measure of divinity.
16. `Devil` - defined as the universal measure of sin.



## üí°Milestone 2
It is important to ensure that each concept is defined in a way that enables
the concept to be described in a way that is universal, consistent, and precise.

To enable this, we must implement a set of methods that will allow us to
describe each concept in its entirety. below is a list of the methods 
that will be used to describe each concept. (draft)

1. `Name` - defined as the universal identifier of the concept.
2. `Description` - defined as the universal descriptor of the concept.
3. `Attributes` - defined as the universal properties of the concept.
4. `Relationships` - defined as the universal connections of the concept.
5. `Events` - defined as the universal occurrences of the concept.
6. `Actions` - defined as the universal interactions of the concept.
7. `Observations` - defined as the universal perceptions of the concept.
8. `Measurements` - defined as the universal quantifications of the concept.
9. `Experiences` - defined as the universal sensations of the concept.
10. `Thoughts` - defined as the universal ideas of the concept.
11. `Emotions` - defined as the universal feelings of the concept.
12. `Memories` - defined as the universal recollections of the concept.
13. `Beliefs` - defined as the universal convictions of the concept.
14. `Values` - defined as the universal priorities of the concept.
15. `Goals` - defined as the universal aspirations of the concept.
16. `Intentions` - defined as the universal intentions of the concept.
17. `Desires` - defined as the universal wishes of the concept.
18. `Needs` - defined as the universal requirements of the concept.
19. `Wants` - defined as the universal preferences of the concept.
20. `Hopes` - defined as the universal expectations of the concept.
21. `Fears` - defined as the universal concerns of the concept.

** the following concepts are not considered fundamental,
 as they are derived from the fundamental concepts above.
 
22. `Dreams` - defined as the universal visions of the concept.
23. `Visions` - defined as the universal dreams of the concept.
24. `Imaginations` - defined as the universal fantasies of the concept.
25. `Fantasies` - defined as the universal imaginations of the concept.



## ‚úíÔ∏è Milestone 3
To fecilitate the open, decentralized, and distributed nature of the Twingverse,
we must represent the fundamentals in a language agnostic , platform agnostic, and
protocol agnostic way. At this point in time, the best way to do this is to use
protocol buffers (Google's open source data interchange format).
Currently protocol buffers are supported in 9 languages and 11 platforms.
Furthermore protobufs will help us to ensure that any revisions to the Twingverse
will be backwards compatible and will not break any existing implementations.

    For more information on protocol buffers, please visit the following link:

## üìö Milestone 4
To Accelerate the development of the Twingverse, we must create a set of tools
that will allow us to easily create, edit, and maintain the Twingverse.
The following tools will be created to help with this:

1. `#Bang` - a web based editor for the Twingverse. This will allow anyone to
easily create, edit, and maintain the Twingverse. It shall also have a built in
visualizer that will allow anyone to visualize the Twingverse in a way that is
easy to understand and comprehend. The system will also have a built in 
version control system that will allow anyone to easily track changes to the
Twingverse. 

2. `#Sling` - a command line tool for the Twingverse. This will allow anyone to
automate the flow of data into and out of the Twingverse by consuming data from
various sources like files, databases, and APIs.
